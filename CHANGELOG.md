# Changelog

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Context Explorer: 3-state terminal visibility eye icons** — timeline rows now show a closed-eye icon (hidden from terminal), dash-eye icon (brief one-liner), or filled green eye+circle (full content shown).
- **Visibility legend** in the Context Explorer bar area labels all three states inline.
- **Help page: Context Explorer section** — documents the two modes, context bar, and timeline with visibility icons.
- **Test coverage** for all new Context Explorer features: canvas bar functions, virtual scroll functions, tab order, eye icon SVGs, visibility legend, session-default navigation, and Help page content (131 → 140 tests).

### Changed
- **Context Explorer tab order** — Real session tab now appears before Example session tab.
- **Default mode on navigation** — opening `#context` now lands on Real session mode (previously Example session).
- **Scroll buttons** replaced emoji arrows with SVG triangles matching the current design language; timeline top/bottom buttons now jump instantly (no smooth-scroll animation).
- **Context bar rendered as a single Canvas node** — replaced stacked `div` segments with a Canvas 2D API implementation for better rendering performance. Hit testing via stored segment coordinates with binary search.
- **Timeline virtual scrolling** — `cw-tl-virt` container now renders only visible rows (+ buffer) with absolute positioning, eliminating DOM bloat on sessions with 1000+ events.
- **Help page section order** — Context Explorer → Token & Usage → Parameters → Data Parsing Reference.

### Fixed
- **Build: template changes now trigger HTML rebuild** — `needsHtmlRebuild()` previously only checked the version string. Now compares mtime of `app.js`, `styles.css`, and `dashboard.html` against `index.html` so template edits are always reflected without manually deleting the output file.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Context Explorer: Real Session Mode** — new `실제 세션` tab that replays any recorded session's actual token usage on the timeline. Click to switch from the example scenario to a real session from your transcript history.
- Session search combobox with prompt-text previews, autocomplete filtering, and two sort modes (`Recent` / `Most turns`).
- Session list integrates with the left-panel global period filter (no separate date dropdown).
- Dynamic context budget — automatically switches between 200K and 1M based on the selected session's peak cumulative tokens (for 1M-context models like `claude-opus-4-6[1m]`).
- Header now shows peak cumulative tokens, current budget, percentage, and the unique model name(s) used in the session.
- Legend hover reveals a floating tooltip with the category's percentage share and token count; uses body-level positioning so edge items never clip against the container.
- Help tooltip explains how the context budget varies per session (model window size).
- Turns sort button has a hover tooltip explaining what "턴" counts (every assistant API response, including each tool invocation).
- URL-hash state persistence (`#context/session`, `#context/{sessionId}`) — refresh, scope change, and period change all preserve the selected session.
- Session events get distinct kind badges (skill / mcp / agent / tool) instead of all showing "claude".
- Parser: `promptStats` now carries a 60-char preview text (with tool-result messages filtered out) so session lists can show recognizable first-prompt snippets.

### Changed
- `fmt()` now formats values ≥1M with the `M` suffix (e.g. `1M`, `1.2M`).
- Example-mode gate cards now show static prompt text instead of editable inputs.
- Example-mode is polished: kept for instruction, but playback state (`typedTexts`, `gateFocusWanted`, `replayMode`) removed along with the input-restore plumbing.
- `.cw-root` height pinned to `calc(100vh - 64px)` with a `min-height: 850px` and balanced 16 px top/bottom padding.
- Top/bottom paddings matched for visual symmetry.
- Stacked bar in session mode is now scaled so its total width equals peak-cumulative/budget, matching the header number exactly. Removed the 0.15%-minimum width clamp that used to inflate the bar on long sessions.
- Terminal-visibility eye icon thicker stroke: `full`=3.5, `brief`=3.

### Fixed
- Session list previously reverted to example mode whenever the global period filter was changed. `contextSubPath` module-level state now keeps session selection across any re-render.
- Re-clicking an already-focused search input now clears the value (was a no-op because focus does not re-fire).
- Legend tooltips on the leftmost category ("System") no longer get clipped by `.cw-root { overflow: hidden }` — switched to a body-level floating tooltip with viewport clamping.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- Banner "seen" state now tracked via URL `?seen=<generatedAt>` instead of `localStorage` — `localStorage` is blocked on `file://` URLs in Chrome, causing the banner to show on every refresh. `history.replaceState` persists across refreshes without any storage API
- `_dateRange` now included in all builds (was only set during first-run), so banner always shows date range
- Banner auto-hide: added `setTimeout` fallback in case `transitionend` event does not fire

## [0.4.6] - 2026-04-04

### Changed
- First-run completion banner now shows only when new data has been generated (compares `generatedAt` with localStorage), and auto-hides after 3 seconds with a fade-out transition

## [0.4.5] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- SKILL.md: `find` now picks the highest semver version from cache (`sort -V | tail -1`) instead of the first filesystem match, preventing older cached versions from being used after an update

## [0.4.4] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- SKILL.md: show explicit error message (`ERROR — generate-dashboard.mjs not found`) and exit 1 when script is not found, instead of silently failing

### Added
- Tests: `test/firstrun.test.mjs` — 10 tests covering `computeDateRange` logic (empty data, null timestamps, multi-scope aggregation) and SKILL.md bash command correctness
- Tests: `web-ui.test.mjs` — `showFirstRunBanner` function, `_firstRun`/`_dateRange` references, CSS classes, locale keys
- Tests: `build.test.mjs` — normal builds must not include `_firstRun` or `_partial` flags

## [0.4.3] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- Plugin path resolution: SKILL.md `find` command now searches `plugins/` cache directory instead of relying on `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (which points to the marketplace mirror, not the versioned install cache with `scripts/`)

### Added
- First-run completion banner: after full data loads on first run, a green banner shows the parsed date range (e.g. "✅ Full data loaded · Jan 1, 2025 – Apr 4, 2026") with an × close button that only disappears on user click

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- Progress output improved: step-numbered messages (`[1/3]`, `[1/4]`) replace generic lines; first-run vs normal-run messaging differentiated
- In-place progress bar (`█░` style) rendered during file collection
- `collectAllScopes` accepts `progress` flag to enable/disable bar rendering
- Update check now queries **GitHub tags** first (primary distribution channel), with npm registry as fallback

### Fixed
- Progress bar newline flushed after collection completes (no broken terminal output)
- Update check now compares versions numerically; pre-publish local versions no longer trigger spurious "downgrade" attempts
- `--update` now runs `git fetch --tags` on the marketplace cache before calling `claude plugin update`, so stale local caches no longer report "already at latest" when a newer version exists on GitHub
- Test: replaced flaky mtime comparison with output-based assertion (macOS APFS sub-ms timestamp precision artifact)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Incremental cache**: Transcript parse results cached as gzipped append-only segments. Only changed files are re-parsed on subsequent runs
- **Progressive loading**: Cold start shows 7-day preview immediately, then loads full data in background with partial banner notification
- **Lightweight mode** (`--data-only`): Uses mtime-index for change detection without loading full cache. Writes plain JSON pending files merged on next `/omh` run
- **Data/shell separation**: `data.js` (data) separated from `index.html` (shell). Shell rebuilt only on version change, data updated independently
- **Update check**: `/omh --update` to check and install latest version. Auto-check runs once per day on `/omh` with 24h cache
- **Migration detection**: Auto-rebuilds on version upgrade with informational message
- **Cache minification**: Key shortening + string interning (model, context, sessionId) reduces cache size ~80%
- **Mtime-index**: Lightweight change detection file with relative paths and common prefix compression

### Changed
- `--data-only` now runs in lightweight mode (no full cache load, no dashboard rebuild)
- Stop hook collects data only (~0.15s), dashboard updates via `data.js`
- Help page: removed install section (redundant for installed users), update via `--update` parameter
- `findSkillFiles` excludes `node_modules`, `.git`, `temp_git_*`, `temp_local_*` directories

### Fixed
- `findSkillFiles` hanging when plugin cache contains `node_modules` directories

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Cost trend charts**: Daily/weekly/monthly cost trend with area gradient (Token: Cost page)
- **Token budget**: Configurable daily/weekly/monthly spending thresholds with progress bars and chart grid lines (localStorage-persisted)
- **Session deep dive**: Clickable top sessions table → detailed view with timeline, models, skills/agents/MCP used (`#session/{id}`)
- **Period comparison**: Compare toggle (⚖) overlays previous period data on stat cards and trend chart
- **Unused items cleanup**: MCP servers added to unused detection; cleanup tip shown when >3 unused items
- **Cache efficiency tips**: Contextual insight cards for low hit rate, high creation/read ratio, no-cache sessions
- **Test suite**: 55 tests covering build output, web-ui templates, plugin structure, and parameter behavior (`npm test`)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project-level instructions for contributors and AI assistants

### Changed
- Token sub-menu restructured into 3 pages: Cost (`#tokens-cost`), Prompt (`#tokens-prompt`), Session (`#tokens-session`)
- Task category and tool context charts moved from Analysis to Token Overview
- Old `#tokens-analysis` route auto-redirects to `#tokens-prompt`
- Session detail sidebar keeps Session menu highlighted

### Fixed
- Marketplace plugin discovery: added `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, aligned `marketplace.json` with official schema
- Install command in README and Help: `oh-my-hi@oh-my-hi-marketplace` → `oh-my-hi@oh-my-hi`
- Budget save/clear no longer scrolls page to top

## [0.2.4] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- Auto-install dependencies (`npm install`) when `node_modules` is missing, preventing `__BB_JS__`/`__EN_DATA__` build errors on first run
- Use dynamic `import()` for esbuild to allow pre-import dependency check

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- Fix `ReferenceError: ko is not defined` crash on Token Analysis page (hourly distribution chart)
- Fix `calcChange()` using strict equality instead of `matchUsageName()` for non-custom date ranges, causing incorrect change percentages for plugin-namespaced skills
- Fix `--data-only` mode still opening/refreshing browser tab (now correctly skips browser activation)

### Removed
- Dead code: unused `renderTokensActivity()` function, duplicate `clipPath` property, unused `totalH` variable

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Update caveat note in README and Help page for known plugin cache issue
- Use `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}` for cross-environment compatibility

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-31

### Changed

- Billboard.js (pkgd) bundled inline — full offline support, no CDN dependencies
- Usage data minification: key shortening + sessionId indexing (14.8MB → 8.5MB, -43%)
- English locale file (`locales/en.json`) — extracted from hardcoded `I18N.en`
- Task category schema file (`work-types.json`) — externalized from build script
- 13 new work type categories (25 total): Refactor, Test, Git, Frontend, Backend, Database, DevOps, Security, Data, Research, i18n, Comms, PM

### Changed
- All i18n strings externalized from app.js to locale files (324 keys)
- Task categories auto-generated at every build (no longer user-editable)
- Category labels use English only (removed per-language labels from schema)
- app.js converted from ES5 to ES6+ (const/let, arrow functions, spread)
- Dark theme CSS dynamically injected via JS (replaces `<style media>` approach)

### Fixed
- Donut chart text color override (`.bb-chart-arc text` specificity)
- `--data-only` help text now matches actual behavior
- Added `node_modules` guard with clear error message
