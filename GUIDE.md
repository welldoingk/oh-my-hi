# Dashboard Guide

A guide to each section of the oh-my-hi dashboard.


## Sidebar

The left sidebar provides navigation, workspace selection, and date range filtering.

### Workspace Selector

Switch between **Global** (your entire Claude Code configuration) and **per-project** scopes. Each scope shows only the harness components and usage data relevant to that workspace.

### Date Range

Filter all usage data by time period:

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **7d** | Last 7 days (today inclusive) |
| **30d** | Last 30 days (today inclusive) |
| **All** | All collected data since first session |
| **📅** | Custom date range picker |
| **⚖** | Compare toggle — overlays previous period data on stat cards and trend chart (7d/30d only) |

Hover over a non-active button to preview the date range in a tooltip. The active range is shown below the buttons.

**Compare mode**: When ⚖ is active, each stat card shows the previous period value below the current value, and the token trend chart overlays the previous period as a gray line. "Previous period" means the same-length window immediately before the current one (e.g., 7d selected → compares last 7 days vs. the 7 days before that).

### Search

Type to filter sidebar items by name. Matches are highlighted across all categories.

### Categories

Below the main navigation, each harness component category is listed with an item count badge. Click to expand and see individual items; click an item to view its detail page.

Categories with more than 50 items show only the first 50 when expanded, followed by a "+N more" button — click it to reveal the rest. Search bypasses the cap entirely since results are already narrowed.

### 💰 Tokens > Cost

Cost analysis and budget tracking.

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Stat Cards** | Total cost, daily average cost, and per-model cost cards. Based on Anthropic API token pricing (not actual CLI subscription billing). |
| **Cost Budget** | Configurable daily/weekly/monthly spending thresholds. Set values and click Save — stored in browser localStorage. Progress bars show current spending vs. budget, with warnings at 80% and exceeded amount + percentage at 100%+. |
| **Cost Trend Charts** | Three area gradient charts (daily in orange, weekly in purple, monthly in green). When a budget is set, a blue dashed grid line marks the threshold. |
| **Cost Calculation** | Expandable section with the pricing formula, collapsible model pricing table (per 1M tokens), and a link to [anthropic.com/pricing](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing). |

#### Cost Calculation Formula

```
Cost = (Input × input price + Output × output price
      + Cache Read × cache read price + Cache Write × cache write price) ÷ 1,000,000
```

Prices are per 1M tokens (USD), sourced from Anthropic's official API pricing. Claude Code CLI is subscription-based, so this estimate is for reference only.

|---------|-------------|
| **Prompt Statistics** | Total prompts, average prompt length (chars), short prompt ratio (≤100 chars), long prompt ratio (≥500 chars). |
| **Response Latency** | Average, median (P50), 95th percentile (P95), and max response time (human→assistant interval). |
| **Hourly Token Distribution** | Bar chart of token usage by hour of day (24h). |
| **Cache Efficiency** | Fresh input, cache read, cache creation token counts with percentages and overall cache hit rate. Followed by contextual tips: low hit rate warnings, high creation/read ratio detection, and session-level cache usage analysis. |

---

### 📋 Tokens > Session

Session-level usage analysis.

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Stat Cards** | Total sessions, average messages per session, average session duration, longest session. |
| **Top Sessions** | Table of up to 20 sessions ranked by token usage. Shows date (with day of week), total tokens, estimated cost, duration, and models used. Click any row to open the session detail view. |

#### Session Detail (`#session/{id}`)

Clicking a session row navigates to a dedicated detail page:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Stat Cards** | Total tokens, estimated cost, duration, message count for this session. |
| **Models Used** | Badges for each model used during the session with call counts. |
| **Skills / Agents / MCP** | Badges showing which skills, agents, and MCP servers were invoked. |
| **Activity Timeline** | Chronological table of every token entry: time, model, context, input/output/cache tokens, and cost. |

Use the "← Back to Sessions" button to return to the session list.

### 🗂️ Structure

Visual overview of your harness architecture.

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Component Flow** | SVG diagram showing how harness components relate to each other, grouped into three layers: **Context** (auto-loaded: CLAUDE.md, rules, principles, memory), **Event-driven** (hooks, MCP servers, plugins), and **User-invoked** (skills, agents, commands, teams, plans). |
| **File Tree** | Expandable tree view listing every registered component by category. Click any item to jump to its detail page. Plugins show active/inactive badges. |

### 🪟 Context Explorer

Interactive simulator that shows what fills the Claude Code context window during a session. Two modes:

| Mode | What it shows |
|------|---------------|
| **Example Session** | A scripted 36-step walkthrough ported from the official docs. Startup values (`CLAUDE.md`, memory, skills, MCP) are your real measured numbers; the rest are illustrative. Use it to understand how a typical session accumulates context. |
| **Real Session** | Pick any real session from your transcript history and replay its actual token usage on the timeline. The search box autocompletes against the first user prompt of each session; sort by recency or total turns. |

**Highlights in Real Session mode**:

- **Session metadata panel** — when a session is selected, a dedicated row under the timeline shows the full first-prompt snippet, date, turn count, model, and peak context. Long prompts that get clipped in the search input stay fully visible here.
- **Dynamic context budget** — the header automatically switches between `200K` and `1M` depending on the peak cumulative input tokens seen in the session (1M-context model variants like `claude-opus-4-6[1m]` trigger the larger budget).
- **Peak-based total** — the header shows the maximum context size reached, not the final entry; this stays meaningful after mid-session `/compact` events.
- **Category legend with hover tooltips** showing each category's percentage share and token count.
- **Detailed per-turn panel** with model, timestamp, cumulative context size, delta, and cache hit ratio.
- **URL persistence** — `#context/{sessionId}` lets you bookmark or refresh without losing state. Changing the sidebar period, scope, or language keeps the selected session.
- **Smart session list scroll** — when the search layer is open, the scroll position is preserved across list close/reopen with the same sort. Only changing the sort criterion resets the list to the top.

Navigation: click 🪟 `Context Explorer` in the sidebar, or use the deep link `#context` (example mode), `#context/session` (session mode, no selection), or `#context/{sessionId}` (session mode, specific session).

## General Features

### Dark / Light Mode

Toggle via the theme button in the sidebar footer. Preference is persisted in `localStorage`.

### Period Comparison

Stat cards with a change percentage compare the selected period against the immediately preceding period of equal length. For example, 7d compares the last 7 days vs. the 7 days before that.

Enable the ⚖ compare toggle in the sidebar to see explicit previous period values on stat cards and a gray overlay line on the token trend chart. Compare mode is available for 7d and 30d periods (disabled for All and custom ranges).

### Data Refresh

Run `/omh --data-only` to collect the latest data without rebuilding the dashboard. The data file (`data.js`) is updated incrementally — only changed transcript files are re-parsed.

Enable auto-refresh with `/omh --enable-auto` to collect data on every session end. Bookmark `output/index.html` and refresh the page anytime to see the latest data.

### Update

Run `/omh --update` to check for and install the latest version. An update check also runs automatically once per day when you use `/omh`.
