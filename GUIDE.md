# Dashboard Guide

A guide to each section of the oh-my-hi dashboard.


## Sidebar

The left sidebar provides navigation, workspace selection, and date range filtering.

### Workspace Selector

Switch between **Global** (your entire Claude Code configuration) and **per-project** scopes. Each scope shows only the harness components and usage data relevant to that workspace.

### Date Range

Filter all usage data by time period:

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **7d** | Last 7 days (today inclusive) |
| **30d** | Last 30 days (today inclusive) |
| **All** | All collected data since first session |
| **📅** | Custom date range picker |

Hover over a non-active button to preview the date range in a tooltip. The active range is shown below the buttons.

### Search

Type to filter sidebar items by name. Matches are highlighted across all categories.

### Categories

Below the main navigation, each harness component category is listed with an item count badge. Click to expand and see individual items; click an item to view its detail page.

## Main Pages

### 📊 Harness (Overview)

The landing page showing a high-level summary of your harness activity.

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Stat Cards** | Total usage, skill calls, agent calls, and command invocations for the selected period. Each card shows the change percentage vs. the previous period. |
| **Category Distribution** | Donut chart showing the proportion of skills, agents, and commands. |
| **Daily Trend** | Line chart of daily activity (skills + agents + commands combined). |
| **Popular Skills** | Top 5 most-used skills ranked by call count. |
| **Activity Heatmap** | GitHub-style calendar heatmap of daily activity intensity. |
| **Recent Activity** | Timeline of the 10 most recent skill, agent, and command invocations. |
| **Unused Items** | Skills and agents that were registered but never called in the selected period. |

### 🪙 Tokens (Overview)

Token usage analytics across all Claude Code sessions.

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Stat Cards** | Total tokens, input tokens, output tokens, cache tokens — each with period-over-period change. |
| **Estimated Cost** | Total cost, daily average cost, and per-model cost cards. Based on Anthropic API token pricing (not actual CLI subscription billing). |
| **Cost Calculation** | Expandable section with the pricing formula, collapsible model pricing table (per 1M tokens), and a link to [anthropic.com/pricing](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing). |
| **Model Distribution** | Donut chart of token usage by model. |
| **Daily Token Usage** | Line chart of daily token consumption trend. |
| **Token Activity** | Calendar heatmap of daily token usage intensity. |
| **Token Usage by Model** | Table breakdown: input, output, cache, total tokens, and estimated cost per model. |
| **Token Insights** | Auto-generated analysis cards covering cache efficiency, response efficiency, model usage, cost breakdown, daily patterns, and peak hours. |

#### Cost Calculation Formula

```
Cost = (Input × input price + Output × output price
      + Cache Read × cache read price + Cache Write × cache write price) ÷ 1,000,000
```

Prices are per 1M tokens (USD), sourced from Anthropic's official API pricing. Claude Code CLI is subscription-based, so this estimate is for reference only.

### 📋 Tokens > Analysis

Deeper analysis of token consumption patterns.

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Tokens by Task Category** | Horizontal bar chart grouping token usage by auto-classified work type (code editing, documentation, planning, etc.). Categories are derived from skill/agent descriptions and saved in `task-categories.json` for customization. |
| **Token Usage by Tool** | Horizontal bar chart of tokens attributed to specific skills, agents, or tools (top 10). |
| **Prompt Statistics** | Total prompts, average prompt length (chars), short prompt ratio (≤100 chars), long prompt ratio (≥500 chars). |
| **Response Latency** | Average, median (P50), 95th percentile (P95), and max response time (human→assistant interval). |
| **Session Analysis** | Total sessions, average messages per session, average session duration, longest session. |
| **Hourly Token Distribution** | Bar chart of token usage by hour of day (24h). |
| **Cache Efficiency** | Fresh input, cache read, cache creation token counts with percentages and overall cache hit rate. |

### 🗂️ Structure

Visual overview of your harness architecture.

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Component Flow** | SVG diagram showing how harness components relate to each other, grouped into three layers: **Context** (auto-loaded: CLAUDE.md, rules, principles, memory), **Event-driven** (hooks, MCP servers, plugins), and **User-invoked** (skills, agents, commands, teams, plans). |
| **File Tree** | Expandable tree view listing every registered component by category. Click any item to jump to its detail page. Plugins show active/inactive badges. |

---

### Category Pages

Click any category in the sidebar (Skills, Agents, Plugins, Hooks, etc.) to see a dedicated page for that category.

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Stat Cards** | Total items, usage count, and period-over-period change. |
| **Popular Items** | Top 5 most-used items within the category (ranked cards). |
| **Activity Heatmap** | Calendar heatmap filtered to this category only. |
| **Recent Activity** | Latest invocations of items in this category. |
| **Unused Items** | Registered items with zero calls in the selected period. |

---

### Item Detail Pages

Click any individual item (skill, agent, plugin, etc.) to see its detail page.

| Section | Description |

### ❓ Help

In-dashboard reference page.

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Usage** | How to run the `/omh` command. |
| **Parameters** | Table of all command parameters (`--data-only`, `--enable-auto`, etc.). |
| **Data Sources** | Reference for each data parser: what files are read and what data is extracted (config files, skills, agents, plugins, hooks, memory, MCP servers, rules, commands, teams, plans, todos, scopes). |
| **Token & Activity** | How token usage, prompt stats, latency, and activity data are parsed from transcript JSONL files. |

## General Features

### Dark / Light Mode

Toggle via the theme button in the sidebar footer. Preference is persisted in `localStorage`.

### Period Comparison

Stat cards with a change percentage compare the selected period against the immediately preceding period of equal length. For example, 7d compares the last 7 days vs. the 7 days before that.

### Data Refresh

Run `/omh --data-only` to regenerate data and the web-ui without opening a new browser tab. Bookmark the generated local file (`output/index.html`) and refresh the page anytime to see the latest data.

Enable auto-refresh with `/omh --enable-auto` to rebuild data on every session end — just refresh the bookmarked tab to see updates.
