# 👋 oh-my-hi (Oh My Harness Insights)
![oh-my-hi dashboard](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude_Code-Plugin-blue)

**Harness Insights** — A visual dashboard for your Claude Code harness.

Parses your entire Claude Code configuration and usage data, then generates an interactive single-file HTML dashboard you can open locally.

## What it shows

- **Harness overview** — skills, agents, plugins, hooks, memory, MCP servers, rules, principles, commands, teams, plans
- **Token analytics** — usage by model, daily trends, cache efficiency, prompt statistics, response latency
- **Activity heatmaps** — daily usage patterns across skills, agents, and commands
- **Task categories** — auto-classified token usage by work type (code editing, docs, planning, etc.)
- **Multi-workspace** — switch between global and per-project scopes

## Installation

#### From the Command Line

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add netil/oh-my-hi
claude plugin install oh-my-hi
```

#### Claude Code (in-session)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add netil/oh-my-hi
/plugin install oh-my-hi@oh-my-hi
```

> Run the same commands to update to the latest version.

> **⚠️ Update caveat:** Due to a [known issue](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/37252) in Claude Code's plugin system, `plugin install` may not detect new versions from the cached marketplace. If the update is not applied, pull the marketplace manually first:
> ```bash
> git -C "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/plugins/marketplaces/oh-my-hi" pull origin main
> ```
> Then run the install command again.

## Usage

Run in Claude Code:

```
/omh
```

This will parse your harness data, build the dashboard, and open it in your browser.

### Parameters

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/omh` | Full build — parse data, build web-ui, open in browser |
| `/omh --data-only` | Regenerate data + web-ui without opening browser |
| `/omh --enable-auto` | Auto-rebuild on session end (registers Stop hook) |
| `/omh --disable-auto` | Disable auto-rebuild |
| `/omh --status` | Check auto-rebuild status |
| `/omh <path>` | Build with specific project paths only |

### Auto-refresh

Enable automatic data refresh so the dashboard stays up to date:

```
/omh --enable-auto
```

This registers a Stop hook that rebuilds the dashboard data whenever a Claude Code session ends. Refresh the browser tab to see the latest data.

## Guide

See **[GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md)** for a detailed walkthrough of each dashboard section — overview, token analytics, cost estimation, structure view, category pages, and more.

## How it works

1. **Parse** — Reads your Claude Code config directory for skills, agents, plugins, hooks, memory, MCP servers, rules, principles, commands, teams, plans, and usage transcripts
2. **Analyze** — Extracts token usage, prompt stats, response latency, activity patterns from `.jsonl` transcripts
3. **Classify** — Auto-categorizes token usage into work types (code editing, docs, planning, etc.) based on skill/agent descriptions. Saves to `task-categories.json` for user customization
4. **Build** — Generates a single `index.html` with all data, CSS, JS, and locale inlined (works with `file://` protocol, no server needed)
5. **Open** — On macOS, reuses an existing browser tab if found (AppleScript). On Windows/Linux, opens a new tab

## i18n

- **English**: Built-in default
- **Other languages**: A template locale file is auto-generated on first build. Translate it and rebuild

## Privacy

All data stays on your machine. `oh-my-hi` reads only local Claude Code config files and transcripts — nothing is sent to external servers. The generated dashboard is a standalone HTML file opened via `file://` protocol, with no network requests. Your usage data, token statistics, and configuration details never leave your local environment.

## Browser support

The dashboard opens as a local `file://` HTML file. No web server required.

On macOS, subsequent builds will refresh the existing browser tab instead of opening a new one (Chrome and Safari supported).
